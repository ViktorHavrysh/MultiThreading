        //
        // It might be surprising that this case even needs to be mentioned, but in fact there are possible
        // implementations of Task.Run() that would allow "0" to be printed instead of "42," at least in theory. After

        // <start task t>, and the read from s_value on Thread 2 will not move before <task t starting>. And, in fact,
        // the Task.Run() and Task.Factory.StartNew() APIs really do guarantee this.
        //
        // All other threading APIs in the .NET Framework, such as Thread.Start() and ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem(),
        // also make a similar guarantee. In fact, nearly every threading API must have some barrier semantics in order
        // to function correctly. These are, unfortunately, almost never documented, but at least they function in a way
        // that seems obvious, so most code does not require always thinking about the memory model of C#.
